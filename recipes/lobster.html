    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ideally recipe for a romantic night, serving for two. A person with little knowledge in cooking can impress your date or partner. The dish will look as if you had ordered from a fancy restaurant.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>2 (4 ounce) lobster tails</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>teaspoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, grated</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 wedges lemon</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an air fryer to 380 degrees F (195 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Butterfly lobster tails by cutting lengthwise through the centers of the hard top shells and meat with kitchen shears. Cut to, but not through, the bottoms of the shells. Spread tail halves apart. Place tails in the air fryer basket with lobster meat facing up.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add lemon zest and garlic; heat until garlic is fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Transfer 2 tablespoons of butter mixture to a small bowl and brush onto lobster tails; discard any remaining brushed butter to avoid contamination from uncooked lobster. Season lobster with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until lobster meat is opaque, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spoon reserved butter from the saucepan over lobster meat. Top with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
        </ol>
